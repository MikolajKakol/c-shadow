## What is c-shadow?

Is it `compose shadow`, `css shadow`, or `see shadow`? Pick your favorite and call it `C shadow`. Aim of this library is to:
* fill the gap of missing shadow feature that should be part of the compose framework
* allow to implement shadows the way that UI designers are used to create for web or iOS
* provide a way to add concave shadows, as elevation only allows convex shadows

Hopefully one day this library will be obsolete and [issue](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/160665122) will be resolved.
